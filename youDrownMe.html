    <h2>You choose the answer, "You will drown me."</h2>
    <p>
      “This… is the correct answer. Since I will drown you, you are lying. But I
      cannot crush you since you are lying, so I cannot do either. You have
      passed the test.”
    </p>

      The octopus carries you and your wife to the ledge, placing you both down
      gently. The thieves thrash and scream, attracting the rage of the massive
      creature. It slams their bodies into the rock wall of the cavern, killing
      them instantly. Then, the octopus splashes the large underwater lake and
      disappears down into its depths. Water covers you and your wife, then
      dissipates, leaving you both safe on the ledge. You sever the zip tie
      around your wife’s wrists with your knife and wrap your arms around her. A
      moment of silent victory remains as you two embrace. After a moment, you
      both release and look into each others’ eyes, but then something shiny at
      your feet catches your attention. The Artifact! It seems the octopus felt
      you have overcome all of your trials and have not only survived and
      rescued your wife, but you have earned a deeply-sought prize.

      GRGRGRGRGRG!! The wall behind you shakes, then opens, revealing a long
      staircase with a light at the top. You both smile, grab the Kritios Boy,
      then begin your trek up the stairs. Eventually, daylight hits your faces
      and you emerge at the side of a peaceful set of hills.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Well done, you’ve achieved the best ending!</strong></p>
    <h3>Thank you for playing!</h3>
