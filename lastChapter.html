    <h2>The Last Chapter</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Ten seconds pass until you hit the blue water, landing next to your
        wife. As she struggles to stay afloat, you grab her and swim to the
        other side, desperate to race the creature below you. The two of you
        struggle to reach another platform on the other side while the water
        around you darkens. The creature is right on your heels.
      </p>
      <p>
        You finally manage to get your wife up on the platform, but you feel a
        tug on your leg. You take a large breath, then you are pulled under the
        water. Traveling at an incredible speed, you realize you are being
        pulled by a tentacle, one of a dozen from a large octopus. As it is
        thrashing you underwater, you manage to pull out your knife from your
        belt and jam it into the tentacle. Blood squirts out and the membrane
        releases your leg. You swim up, hoping to make it to the surface for
        another gulp of air before it grabs you again.
      </p>
      <p>“GHHHAA!” You gasp for air.</p>
      <p>
        The cavern is massive, and you are in the middle of the pool, far from
        any edge. Looking around, you see your wife is safe on one ledge, and on
        the opposite side, the thieves are watching the octopus swimming under
        you, hoping for it to get you. They are trying to fire their guns at
        you, but the water has jammed them. You glance down to see the shadow
        nearing you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, the octopus emerges from the water, a colossal creature. Tentacles
        whip out, reaching everyone in the room, including your wife. You too
        are also now captive, held upside-down from your legs, suspended above
        the water like everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, another tentacle appears, holding the golden artifact. You see the
        shiny treasure, but you are more concerned with your wife. Everyone is
        helpless, left to the mercy of the octopus. The slimy body moves around,
        inspecting everyone. It’s black-eyed gaze falls upon you and stops. You
        feel an ominous sensation, as if it has chosen you.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Mortal…” the voice of the creature echoes in your head. “the fate of
        you and your loved one lie in your wisdom. Tell me the answer to this
        riddle, and I shall set you free. If you lie, I will drown you. If you
        tell the truth, I will crush you. What is your answer?”
