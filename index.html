        The shadows of the Dionysus hides a vast series of underground ruins
        recently discovered. The mapping of the surface ruins have attracted
        many things from tourists to vandals. However, the ruins go deeper than
        discovered, and legends tell of an ancient and priceless artifact that
        exists at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are on vacation with your wife, part of the Dionysus tour. The
        underground ruins travel below the theatre of Dionysus, snaking along
        various attractions. Stanchions prevent tourists from venturing off the
        path, but the intrigue of mysterious tunnels capture the curious. You
        and your wife drag behind the tour group and manage to explore one of
        the “forbidden” tunnels, grabbing a torch along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you delve deeper into the untapped ruins, you discover an entire
        world left out of the tour. The path is surrounded by mysterious statues
        of old Greek gods, but also deep holes that drop into pure darkness. You
        two watch your steps carefully as you curiously venture further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alone in a timeless world, you suddenly hear voices. They aren’t part of
        the tour group.
      </p>
      <p>“Hey!” says a grim voice from behind.</p>
      <p>
        You and your wife turn around to see a small group of thieves standing
        not more than 10 feet away. In the center of the group is a man with a
        fedora, a pistol by his side, and a scroll drooping from his hand. He
        develops a sinister smile and steps forward, rolling his treasure map
        up.
      </p>
      <p>
        You stand in front of your wife. “Um.. sorry,” you say. “we were just
        heading back to the tour group-”
      </p>
      <p>
        The man with the fedora draws his pistol on you and replies. “You ain’t
        going nowhere. I know you two have come down here for the treasure!”
      </p>
      <p>“No, sir, we just got lost, and-”</p>
      <p>
        WHAM! He hits you with the butt of his pistol, knocking you to the
        ground. As you recover, you hear your wife’s screams and witness the men
        taking her. One of them presses his foot on your chest while the others
        carry her deeper into the ruins.
      </p>
      <p>
        “She’ll be our… canary!” says the leader as he ushers his group down a
        corridor. They disappear, leaving the lone thief to finish you off.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man pressing his foot on your chest looks away at the group for a
        quick moment, leaving you a chance to do something. You want to grab the
        knife from your belt, but it is pressed against the ground. However,
        next to you is a large rock. You grab the rock and swing it across just
        as he looks back at you, smashing his foot. CRACK! The rock lands
        squarely on his toes, and he immediately steps off. He stumbles back and
        accidentally falls over the railing, plunging into the depths of the
        hole.
      </p>
      <p>“AAAaagggghhh…” His screams fade before he hits the bottom.</p>
      <p>
        You wipe the blood from your forehead and dust your clothes off.
        Desperate to get your wife back, you head towards the corridor in which
        the group disappeared. As you round the corner, the path splits. You
        grab the nearby torch and examine each corridor.
