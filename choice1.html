    <div>
      <p>
        The sight of gold and riches attract you down a tunnel, and eventually
        in a dead-end room illuminating with shiny statues of Greek gods. As you
        walk further in, gold coins litter the ground, demanding your attention!
        You kneel down and stuff your pockets full of everything shiny.
      </p>
      <p>SLAM! The corridor behind you shuts, trapping you.</p>
      <p>
        HSSSSSS! A green gas fills the room, quickly enveloping your lungs. You
        hack your last breath, and collapse to the ground.
      </p>
      <p><strong>THE END</strong></p>
