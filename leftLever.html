    <h2>You pull the left Lever!</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the ceiling begins to slowly fall, and the door behind you
        slowly shuts. Just as the thieves notice what is happening, you rush in
        and grab your wife, tossing her through the doorway before it closes.
        The thieves draw their pistols and aim in your direction. As you follow
        your wife into the door, bullets pop and fly into the hallway. The door
        closes, sealing the thieves in the trapped room. Their screams echo as
        the ceiling crushes their bodies, then silence. You and your wife have
        made it out alive.
      </p>
      <p>“NO!” Your wife yells, as she stares at your chest.</p>
      <p>
        Then, you feel a wave of heat through your body, following by a deathly
        cold. You look down to see your chest riddled with bullets. You fall to
        your knees, then slump to the ground. Everything goes dark as you let
        out your last breath.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>THE END</strong></h2>
