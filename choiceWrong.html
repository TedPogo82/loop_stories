    <p>
      The flames on the sconces flicker, then burst into a fiery explosion.
      Before you could jump back to avoid them, the flames set your clothes
      ablaze. You jump into the waterfall, plunging into a water so dark and
      deep, you donâ€™t know where it goes. As the water puts out your fire, a six
      foot eel emerges and locks eyes with you. You attempt to swim out, but the
      eel wraps its body around yours, preventing you from swimming away. Water
      fills your lungs and soon, the silence of death takes a hold.
