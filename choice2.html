    <h2 class="right-choice">You choose the dark corridor with cobwebs!</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Not sure about the cobwebs and the darkness, your gut still tells you
        this is the right path. You clutch your torch with both hands and slowly
        creep down the tunnel. Spiders crawl into the small cracks of the
        cavernous tunnel at your approach, and despair begins to find its way
        into the recesses of your mind. Before you completely lose hope, you
        find your wife’s hair claw on the ground!
      </p>
      <p>
        With a flicker of hope, you press on, continuing down the dark corridor.
        Eventually, you emerge to a cavern with a waterfall, dropping down past
        the walkway into a deep dark pool. As you proceed past the waterfall,
        you see a wooden door on the other side of the cavern. Two ornate
        sconces are mounted on both sides of the door, illuminating the end of
        the room. You are sure the theives went through this door, as it is the
        only exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you near the door, you notice a sign nailed to it. Click! Before the
        door, you stepped on a small stone platform that activated a mechanism
        somewhere in the wall. You look around any immediate danger, but
        whatever trap has sprung seems to be either malfunctioned, or hasn’t
        presented itself yet. Still, you remain cautious. You read the sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What has one voice but goes on four legs in the morning, two in the
        afternoon, and three in the evening?” Below the riddle are three stone
        buttons with pictures. You are certain the wrong choice will spell
        disaster.
