        The correct answer is the human. It crawls on all fours as a baby, walks
        on two legs, then walks with a cane when old.

        The door opens, showing the way forward. Immediately, you enter a
        corridor of stone, sand, and more sconces. Etched into the trim of the
        walls are floral patterns, swirling around deities. You suddenly feel
        like you are back in time, roaming under the city of Athens.

      <p>
        The hallway stretches in both directions. Do you choose to go left or
        right?
