    <h2>You decide to wait and watch the thieves' next move.</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        You hesitate to pull the levers, unsure of what they will do. You wait
        behind the statue and watch the man with the fedora hat approach the
        altar. He steps towards it, about to grab the treasure, when the floor
        gives out, dropping everyone down a chute, including the artifact. Their
        screams echo as they freefall down. As the only one left in the room,
        you look down to see they have landed in a large cavern of water. You
        watch them swim to the edge of the massive pool and crawl onto a
        platform. However, your wife is struggling to swim since her arms are
        tied.
      </p>
      <p>
        You think of dropping down, when you see a massive shadow swimming in
        the water. It circles your wife, curious. Without any more hesitation,
        you jump in.
