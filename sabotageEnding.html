    <h2>You jump down!</h2>
    <p>
      In a desperate move, you climb over the balconyâ€™s ledge and lower yourself
      over the top of one of the thieves. You let go and drop, landing on him,
      knocking him out. As you rise to take on the others, they quickly draw
      their pistols and fire at you. You try to run, but the bullets are too
      fast. Riddled with bullets, you collapse to the ground and fall victim to
      the fate of the afterlife.

    <h2><strong>THE END</strong></h2>
