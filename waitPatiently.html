    <h2>You stay hidden up in the balcony, watching their next move.</h2>
    <p>
      You decide that ambushing them is out of the question, since you only have
      a knife, and they have guns and outnumber you. So you wait, hoping for an
      opportunity to grab your wife and escape. You wait behind the balcony
      ledge and watch the man with the fedora hat approach the altar. He steps
      towards it, about to grab the treasure, when the floor gives out, dropping
      everyone down a chute, including the artifact. Their screams echo as they
      freefall down. As the only one left in the room, you look down to see they
      have landed in a large cavern of water. You watch them swim to the edge of
      the massive pool and crawl onto a platform. However, your wife is
      struggling to swim since her arms are tied.
