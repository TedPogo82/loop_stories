        Suddenly, the doors slam shut and a hundred tiny holes in the walls
        open, revealing blowpipes. Then, poison darts shoot from the blowpipes,
        hitting everyone in the room. Trapped, everyone falls to the fast acting
        poison. You too are hit, even only once in the leg. The poison travels
        through your veins and into your heart. You feel your heart beat slower
        and slower. And finally one. Last. Beat.
