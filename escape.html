    <h2>You found the correct answer!</h2>
    <p>
      The door opens, revealing a staircase that winds up a flight, then leads
      to another room. As you near the room, you hear voices echoing. You walk
      out carefully, emerging to the top level of a highly illuminated golden
      treasure room. You are on a balcony, which looks down into the treasure
      room. The thieves are below holding your wife captive! And in the middle
      is an altar with a gold statuette of The Kritios Boy, the treasured
      artifact!
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching the altar is the leader with the fedora hat, and behind him
      are his henchmen holding your wife hostage. Her hands are bound and tears
      rolls down her cheeks. She is patiently waiting for your rescue, remaining
      in the mercy of the men.
