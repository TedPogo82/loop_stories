    <h2>You turn right and head down the corridor.</h2>
    <p>
      The long shaft eventually leads you to a stone door. There doesn’t seem to
      be any sort of door knob or mechanism to move the heavy door, nor can you
      even attempt to push it. On both sides of the door are two statues,
      depicting Zeus and his wife Metis.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the face of the door is a small inscription that says.
      <em
        >“Athena was herculEs’ half-siSter, but also the goddess of military
        victory and wisdom. As the patron of the City of Athens, her Parents
        were zeus and mEtis.”</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Then below that is a series of stone buttons, letters of the alphabet,
      with the message above it saying, “What is the hidden word?”
